# User Manager Library
This is a redesign of a preexisting user management system. This redesign Adds modularity, maintainability, reuse-ability and documentation. It is a tool kit used to start new web applications associated with GreenRiverTech. This library will cut development time down by abstracting all the user data management utility. To put simply what this library does is convert multiple blocks of code into one line solutions.
